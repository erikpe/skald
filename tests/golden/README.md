# Golden Tests

Golden tests compile complete `.ska` programs and assert one or more externally visible results: successful compilation, diagnostics, emitted assembly properties, link success, and process exit status.

Keep each case focused. Architecture-independent cases should be reusable across backends; target-specific assembly assertions should be clearly separated from semantic expectations.
