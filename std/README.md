# Standard Library

This directory contains the installed Skald standard-library source. The
canonical `std::str::Str` module provides the frozen byte-string descriptor,
safe byte-copying construction, checked observation and slicing, independent
array conversion, and concatenation. Current output operations remain
bootstrap C runtime functions rather than the final I/O API.

The `std::error` module declares the compiler-known
`panic(message: std::str::Str) -> unit` intrinsic and imports `std::str`
explicitly. Call statements execute through the compiler's non-returning panic
terminator and the length-delimited runtime reporter. It is not an external
function or an exception API.

`std::str` selectively imports that panic declaration for invalid byte and
slice bounds, forming an ordinary two-module import cycle with `std::error`.
The cycle has no initialization-order consequences because modules contain no
executable top-level state.

Import and call it as a standalone statement:

```ska
from std::error import panic;

fn main() -> i64 {
    panic("configuration is missing");
}
```

The reporter writes `panic: `, the exact string bytes, and a line feed to
standard error, then terminates unsuccessfully. It does not unwind or run
remaining cleanup.

Named private standard-library members begin with `_` by convention, including
private fields and private instance or static methods. Declarations without a
member name, such as `private init(...)`, are unchanged. Parameters and local
variables use ordinary descriptive names unless they independently require an
underscore.

The public string contract is documented in
[Skald Strings](../docs/language/STRINGS.md). Broader library scope remains an
[open design area](../docs/language/STATUS.md#not-implemented).
