# Active and Planned Roadmaps

This directory contains implementation roadmaps that are planned or in
progress. Completed roadmaps and resolved discovery records move to
[`../archive/`](../archive/README.md).

## In progress

No implementation roadmap is currently in progress. The completed interface-
based operator-overloading, general-iteration, and generic-interface roadmaps
are preserved in the [archive](../archive/README.md).

## Planned

The [generic ranges and tight range loops roadmap](GENERIC_RANGES_ROADMAP.md)
is planned; canonical successor protocols and primitive realizations are next.
It delivers ordinary explicit `Range<T>` values first, `..` syntax and ordinary
execution second, and immediate integer range-loop fusion plus measured
handwritten-`while` parity last. It depends on the completed generic-interface,
general-iteration, and interface-based operator-overloading work.

## Design proposals

No design proposal is currently active. The frozen generic-range contract is
promoted into the [language](../language/RANGES.md) and
[compiler](../compiler/RANGES.md) documentation, and its
[decision record](../archive/GENERIC_RANGES_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md) is preserved in
the archive.

The frozen interface-based operator-overloading contract is promoted into the
[language](../language/OPERATOR_OVERLOADING.md) and
[compiler](../compiler/OPERATOR_OVERLOADING.md) documentation, and its
decision record is preserved in the [archive](../archive/README.md).

The completed general iteration design and delivery record are preserved in
the [archive](../archive/README.md).

The confirmed generic interfaces decisions and completed delivery history are
preserved in the
[archive](../archive/GENERIC_INTERFACES_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md) and
[completed roadmap](../archive/GENERIC_INTERFACES_ROADMAP.md), and promoted
into focused implemented language and compiler contracts.

The completed private cell fields design and implementation roadmap are
preserved in the [archive](../archive/PRIVATE_CELL_FIELDS_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md).

The confirmed structural indexing and slicing decisions are preserved in the
[archive](../archive/STRUCTURAL_INDEXING_AND_SLICING_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md).

The confirmed capture-free function-value decisions and completed
implementation roadmap are preserved in the
[archive](../archive/FUNCTION_VALUES_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md) and promoted into the
focused living language and compiler contracts.

Frozen design proposals and their completed implementation roadmaps are
preserved in the [archive](../archive/README.md).

## Pending discoveries

No implementation discoveries are currently pending.

## Implementation baseline

The completed initial module system, polymorphism, object-cast, and constructor
profiles remain the implementation baseline. Module behavior is specified by
the implemented
[language contract](../language/MODULES_AND_INTEROP.md#initial-module-system)
and [compiler contract](../compiler/MODULE_SYSTEM.md). Constructor overload
and explicit-copy semantics are specified in
[Classes and Lifecycle](../language/CLASSES_AND_LIFECYCLE.md).
Shared-ownership language and implementation contracts are current in
[Shared Ownership and Heap Allocation](../language/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md) and
the
[Shared-Ownership Compiler and Runtime Contract](../compiler/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md),
including ordinary allocation and explicit exact-class copy allocation from a
target-directed checked source. Dynamic-type-preserving cloning remains
deferred.
Checked exceptions remain the later exploratory direction because they extend
cleanup to exceptional control flow. Other unscheduled language directions
and their maturity are owned by the
[status matrix](../language/STATUS.md#not-implemented).
