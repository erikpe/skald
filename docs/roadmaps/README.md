# Active and Planned Roadmaps

This directory contains implementation roadmaps that are planned or in
progress. Completed roadmaps and resolved discovery records move to
[`../archive/`](../archive/README.md).

## In progress

[Capture-free function values](FUNCTION_VALUES_ROADMAP.md) is in progress.
Recursive function-type syntax, canonical closed `FunctionTypeId` identity,
exact ordinary and closed-specialization callable references, deterministic
address-taken metadata, trivial stored/callable HIR, and complete indirect-call
argument/result planning are implemented behind a driver pre-MIR gate. FVI5
is next and will lower and verify callable addresses and indirect MIR calls.

## Planned

No implementation roadmap is currently planned but not started.

## Design proposals

The confirmed structural indexing and slicing decisions are preserved in the
[archive](../archive/STRUCTURAL_INDEXING_AND_SLICING_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md).

The confirmed capture-free function-value decisions are preserved in the
[archive](../archive/FUNCTION_VALUES_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md) and promoted into the
focused living contracts linked from the planned roadmap.

Frozen design proposals and their completed implementation roadmaps are
preserved in the [archive](../archive/README.md).

## Pending discoveries

No implementation discoveries are currently pending.

## Implementation baseline

The completed initial module system, polymorphism, object-cast, and constructor
profiles remain the implementation baseline. Module behavior is specified by
the implemented
[language contract](../language/MODULES_AND_INTEROP.md#initial-module-system)
and [compiler contract](../compiler/MODULE_SYSTEM.md). Constructor overload
and explicit-copy semantics are specified in
[Classes and Lifecycle](../language/CLASSES_AND_LIFECYCLE.md).
Shared-ownership language and implementation contracts are current in
[Shared Ownership and Heap Allocation](../language/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md) and
the
[Shared-Ownership Compiler and Runtime Contract](../compiler/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md),
including ordinary allocation and explicit exact-class copy allocation from a
target-directed checked source. Dynamic-type-preserving cloning remains
deferred.
Checked exceptions remain the later exploratory direction because they extend
cleanup to exceptional control flow. Other unscheduled language directions
and their maturity are owned by the
[status matrix](../language/STATUS.md#not-implemented).
