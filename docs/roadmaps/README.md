# Active and Planned Roadmaps

This directory contains implementation roadmaps that are planned or in
progress. Completed roadmaps and resolved discovery records move to
[`../archive/`](../archive/README.md).

## In progress

- [While Loops and Loop Exits Roadmap](WHILE_LOOPS_ROADMAP.md) — **in
  progress; repeatable MIR storage lifetime epochs are complete and cycle-safe
  verification is next**. Delivers cycle-safe storage and verification
  foundations before activating source `while`, then adds `break` and
  `continue` as separate slices.

## Planned

No implementation roadmaps are currently planned.

## Design proposals

No design proposals are currently awaiting decisions or promotion.

## Pending discoveries

No maintainability discoveries are currently pending.

## Implementation baseline

The completed initial module system, polymorphism, object-cast, and constructor
profiles remain the implementation baseline. Module behavior is specified by
the implemented
[language contract](../language/MODULES_AND_INTEROP.md#initial-module-system)
and [compiler contract](../compiler/MODULE_SYSTEM.md). Constructor overload
and explicit-copy semantics are specified in
[Classes and Lifecycle](../language/CLASSES_AND_LIFECYCLE.md).
Shared-ownership language and implementation contracts are current in
[Shared Ownership and Heap Allocation](../language/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md) and
the
[Shared-Ownership Compiler and Runtime Contract](../compiler/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md),
including ordinary allocation and explicit exact-class copy allocation from a
target-directed checked source. Dynamic-type-preserving cloning remains
deferred.
Checked exceptions remain the later exploratory direction because they extend
cleanup to exceptional control flow. Other unscheduled language directions
and their maturity are owned by the
[status matrix](../language/STATUS.md#not-implemented).
