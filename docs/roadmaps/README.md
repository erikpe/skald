# Active and Planned Roadmaps

This directory contains implementation roadmaps that are planned or in
progress. Completed roadmaps and resolved discovery records move to
[`../archive/`](../archive/README.md).

- [Object Casts Discoveries](OBJECT_CASTS_DISCOVERIES.md) — pending
  resolved-receiver representation follow-up found while implementing checked
  cast places; it is bounded to later cast/compiler work.

The completed polymorphism profile remains the implementation baseline.
Shared-ownership language and implementation contracts are frozen in
[Shared Ownership and Heap Allocation](../language/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md) and
the
[Shared-Ownership Compiler and Runtime Contract](../compiler/SHARED_OWNERSHIP.md),
including ordinary allocation and explicit exact-class copy allocation from a
checked cast place. Dynamic-type-preserving cloning remains deferred.
Checked exceptions remain the later exploratory direction because they extend
cleanup to exceptional control flow. Other unscheduled language directions
and their maturity are owned by the
[status matrix](../language/STATUS.md#not-implemented).
